Getting and Cleaning Data / Coursera / Course-Project
=====================================================

Introduction
------------
The goal of the course project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The raw data set used is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (see the codebook for futher details).
This repository includes:
- this README.md markdown file;
- a run_analysis.R R script file that creates a tidy data set from the UCI HAR Dataset;
- a CodeBook.md markdown file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

Requirements
------------
Running the R script with R requires:
- the R dplyr package installed
- the UCI HAR Dataset in your working directory.
* Remark: if the UCI HAR Dataset is not in your working directory the R script will download it from the web and unzip its content in your working directory *
